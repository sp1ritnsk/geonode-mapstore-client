# GeoNode MapStore Client Static Files

This folder contains all the static files needed to make the client works.
The following directories and files are replaced for each build process so they should not be modified:

- `ms-translations/` this directory contains all the translation copied from the MapStore submodule
- `dist/` this directory contains all the js and css bundles
- `version.txt` a file to store the current compiled version

All the other static configuration files can be updated directly in this directory
